# Asgard GPU Cluster

Asgard is a small-scale GPU cluster prototype designed for reproducible,
containerized machine learning and high-performance workloads.

The system combines:
- Slurm for job scheduling
- Enroot and Pyxis for containerized execution
- A structured file system for data management
- Grafana for monitoring GPU usage and system health

This documentation explains both **how to use** the cluster and **how it is built**.
